# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from Computer Science and Engineering college students who are interested in enhancing our project and gaining hands-on experience. To ensure a collaborative and productive environment, we have established the following guidelines:

1. **Familiarize Yourself with the Project**: Before making contributions, take some time to understand the project's purpose, goals, and existing codebase. Read the project documentation, review the code, and explore any relevant resources provided.

2. **Choose an Issue**: Browse the list of open issues in the project's issue tracker. Choose an issue that aligns with your skills, interests, and experience. If you have a new feature or bug fix in mind that is not listed, consider opening a new issue to discuss it with the project maintainers.

3. **Claiming an Issue**: To avoid duplication of effort, comment on the issue you wish to work on and request to claim it. The project maintainers will assign the issue to you if it is available.

4. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the project repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project that you can freely modify and experiment with.

5. **Branching**: Create a new branch in your forked repository. Use a descriptive name for the branch that reflects the purpose of your contribution. This will help in managing multiple contributions and ease the reviewing process.

6. **Code Style and Conventions**: Follow the project's coding style and conventions. Maintain consistency with the existing codebase, including indentation, variable naming, commenting conventions, and any other style guidelines mentioned in the project documentation.

7. **Commit Guidelines**: Make concise and meaningful commits. Provide a clear and descriptive commit message that explains the changes made in the commit. If your contribution addresses a specific issue, reference the issue number in the commit message using the appropriate syntax.

8. **Testing**: Whenever applicable, include appropriate tests for your code changes. Ensure that existing tests pass successfully. Write new tests to cover any new functionality or bug fixes.

9. **Documentation**: Document your code changes whenever necessary. Update relevant documentation, including code comments, README.md, or any other documentation files affected by your contribution.

10. **Pull Request**: Once you have completed your changes, submit a pull request from your branch to the main project repository. Provide a detailed description of your changes, including relevant context and any additional information that may help with the review process.

11. **Review and Feedback**: Expect feedback and suggestions from the project maintainers during the review process. Address any requested changes promptly and engage in constructive discussions.

12. **Be Respectful and Inclusive**: Maintain a respectful and inclusive environment throughout your contributions. Be considerate of diverse perspectives and respect the ideas and opinions of others. Harassment or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated.

By following these guidelines, you will contribute to the project effectively and foster a positive collaborative environment.

Thank you for your interest and contributions!
